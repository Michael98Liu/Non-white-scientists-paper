This repository contains data and code required to reproduce the findings in paper "Non-White scientists appear on fewer editorial boards, spend
more time under review, and receive fewer citations", *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)*, in press. This repository is organized in the following way:

- A data file is anonymized if it contains identifiers that could reveal the identity of papers/authors/editors; all analyzed data can be found in the `data\` directory.
- Notebooks and code related to the data anonymization process can be found in the `0_anonymization` repository; code used for analysis and visualization can be found in the `1_underrepresentation`, `2_acceptance_delay`, and `3_citation_well` directories.
- `figures/` contains the visualization of the main results.
